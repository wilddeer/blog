Hey! My name is Oleg Korsunsky, I'm front-end web developer. I do some [experimenting](/en/experiments/), write about [rare browsers](/en/rare-species/), [code some stuff](/en/scripts/).

Responsive and accessible user experiences, graceful degradation and progressive enhancement -- all that modern hipster shit, ya know, -- I'm into this kind of stuff.

Enjoy my shitty English!
